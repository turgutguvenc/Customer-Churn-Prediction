# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service. Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the customer itself.
Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.
To reduce customer churn, companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. With my code following link which has gotten very high score from other machine learning practitioners at kaggle.com, I detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, including store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, Web-based transactions, and social media interactions.
